# Customer_Churn_prediction


This project aims to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or subscribers, and predicting churn helps businesses take proactive steps to retain customers. The dataset used contains customer details, service usage, and churn labels.

Features-:

1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns and correlations in customer data.

3.Model Training: Using a multi-layered Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for churn prediction.

4.Performance Evaluation: Assessing the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

5.Deployment: Optionally deploying the model using Flask, Streamlit, or a cloud service.
